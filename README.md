# Analysis of Action|universe evolution path: Comparison with Hamiltonian and Lagrangian

 Analysis of Action|universe evolution path 
 
The dimension of the action quantity is consistent with that of Planck constant, so the action quantity can be the number of units of quantum energy (Planck constant).

The total number of unit quantum conduction energy of a physical process involves two parameters, one is the number n of SEQ involved in the physical process wave conduction, and the other is the conduction times kᵢ of the ith SEQ involved in the conduction, in which the maximum number of conduction count kᵢ of all single SEQ is less than or equal to times of local spatial transformations in this process. h is Planck constant. Then the action amount can also be written as

 ∑hkᵢ, i∈N                 ③
 
The law of the principle of least action reveals that the path selected by physics process is the path that the total amount of energy conduction involved SEQ is the least. It involves two parameters, as mentioned above. If the number of SEQ involved remains the same and the conduction times of each SEQ are the same, (1)Fermat's principle of the shortest time of optical path and (2)the principle of the steepest descent line can be directly derived, because in these two examples, the number of SEQ involved in the physical process and the rolling spherical rigid body in the steepest descent line remain the same, and the conduction times of each SEQ are also approximately the same, then time (the number of local space transformations) is the only variable for the calculation of action, so using time to divide the wave forms of different paths is equivalent to using action to divide the wave forms of different paths. Time here refers to the transformation times of local space. From this point of view, we can probably understand why the analysis of action amount proposed in different periods is different, but it can explain some phenomena.

The model assumes that each transmission of SEQ can only carry energy in discrete units of Planck's constant h, where the principle of least action corresponds to minimizing the number of transmission steps. When spacetime is curved, the stretched regions exhibit lower SEQ density, requiring fewer quanta for energy propagation. However, as discussed in later sections, deformation modulates the resonant frequencies of SEQ, and the elastic properties differ between compressed and stretched phases. This necessitates a comprehensive consideration of transmission pathways through both compressed and stretched regions.

Crucially, the stretched path with reduced SEQ density remains the dominant route for minimal action propagation. In this model framework, Planck time defines the fundamental-minimum period of SEQ harmonic oscillation (corresponding to the maximum resonant frequency). Both compression and stretching deformations increase the SEQ harmonic period (reducing frequency and slowing spacetime transformation rates), though with different modulation strengths. Despite this asymmetry, the stretched path's advantage in requiring fewer transmission steps persists, consistent with the observed convex trajectory of light around black holes.

Quantitative implementation of this model requires future development of discrete formulations of general relativistic field equations and variational principles to properly account for the asymmetric effects of spacetime deformation on SEQ network propagation. The current conceptual framework demonstrates self-consistency while providing a novel discrete approach to understanding spacetime dynamics at quantum scales.

## Comparison with Hamiltonian and Lagrangian：

Compared with the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian, the analytical expression herein does not explicitly contain a potential energy term. In subsequent sections (section 9 to section 10), it will be mentioned that any form of metric change in space leads to a decrease in SEQ resonance frequency - resonance frequency modulation.

Thus, the actual analytical expression in this chapter has already implicitly included the potential energy term. Conversely, under this model, the essence of the potential energy term in the analytical expressions of the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian is the modulation of the number of energy transmissions. Under this model, gravitational potential energy, electromagnetic potential energy, weak interaction potential energy, and strong interaction potential energy are essentially the elastic potential energy of tensor or twist distortion of space.

 To elaborate further:
 
The absence of an explicit potential energy term in the analytical herein expression is compensated by the concept that any form of metric change in space results in a reduction of SEQ resonance frequency. This implies that the potential energy term is inherently embedded within the formulation via resonance frequency modulation.

The essence of the potential energy terms in both the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formulations, under this model, can be understood as modulations in the frequency of energy transmission events.

Gravitational potential energy, electromagnetic potential energy, weak interaction potential energy, and strong interaction potential energy are all fundamentally manifestations of the elastic potential energy resulting from distortions in the spatial tensors or twists.

The essence of potential energy release is the reduction of spatial distortion, which is accompanied by an increase in SEQ resonance frequency.
